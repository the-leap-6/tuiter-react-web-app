  <h2>What is technology?</h2>
  <p>WheelEtymologically the term technology comes from the combination of these two Greek morphemes tékhnē, (meaning “art”) and ‎-logía (meaning “study”). It refers to the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.</p>
  <p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Agricultural Revolution increased the available sources of food. Likewise, the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Later developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power.</p>
